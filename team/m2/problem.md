# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Currently there is no organized way to view community related events in a cohesive application. Students and individuals must use university websites such as Campus Pulse or rely on social media (Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram) to find local events. This approach makes it challenging to keep up-to-date with upcoming events happening nearby. 

## Proposed Solution

Our proposed web application, **OpenInvite**, aims to centralize the process of discovering and engaging with public events. Users will be able to advertise their "open invite" events which are directly visible to the public and displayed within a certain distance of the event's location. 

Key features include:

- **Event Creation**: Users can easily create and publicize their events specifying details such as location, time, description and additional information.
- **Location Based Discovery**: Events will be displayed in chronological order and proximity to user.
- **User Friendly Interface**: OpenInvite offers an intuitive and easily understood interface allowing users to find events quickly.
- **Multi-Device Access**: This app will be available on both desktop and mobile devices to ensure maximum accessibility

**OpenInvite** aims to consolidate all local events into one centralized platform to streamline the event discovery and participation process. 

## Why This Matters

Event participation is integral for people--especially students--to network, socialize and unwind; however, discovery of such events can be difficult due to a lack of a centralized platform. **OpenInvite** simplifies the process of finding and publishing events, some of which may be overlooked if users were not actively searching for a specific event.

**OpenInvite** offers a convenient and comprehensive view of all published activities in the area--driving community participation and engagement. In the long run, this app will help foster meaningful connections among various members of the local community and builds a stronger and more connected community on campus and beyond.
