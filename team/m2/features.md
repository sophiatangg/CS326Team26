# Application Features

## Event Creation

This feature enables users and organizations to create an open-invite event that can reach the public and the broader community. The interface is designed to guide organizers through each step of the event setup, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately and efficiently. From adding an image to the event to selecting one of the preset categories, the process will encourage those interested to come. Users and organizations will be limited on the number of posts they can make within a day.

## Category-specific Feed

Users will be allowed to find events in a certain category, displaying all events in that category. From there, they can once again use the filter to sort by location or time posted. On this feed, they are allowed to click further into the display, bringing them up to the specific event page. The specific event page allows them to further like an event, which will add the event's category to their list of interests in their profile.

## Event finder
The Event finder will be used to filter out events based on users' choice. We will have pre-set college areas across the country to choose from and the events will be sorted from the most recent to the furthest one. Also, the user can search specific keywords, and events which match the keyword will be displayed. This will help the user in searching events near them.

## Profiles
The profile section will provide more details about the organizations or individuals who post events. This will give the organizers a chance to introduce themselves, describe what kind of events they host and provide the audience with contact information such as social media platforms or their own website.
