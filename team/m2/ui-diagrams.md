## Main Screen

The **Main Screen** serves as the user's entry point after logging into the app, offering a curated feed of events happening in their area. The design is clean and visually engaging, showcasing event posts that include images, descriptions, the event host's name, and the number of likes. Users can explore a variety of events, from concerts and parties to study sessions.

The screen provides a variety of interactive elements:

1. **Posts**: Each post features an event image, title, a short description, and the number of likes. The name of the event host appears at the top, helping users identify who shared the event.
2. **Filters and Sorting**: Located at the top right of the feed, the filter and sort options allow users to tailor their feed. Events can be filtered by interests, while sorting can be adjusted to show the nearest upcoming events or the most recent posts.
3. **Search Bar**: Positioned at the top of the screen, the search bar allows users to find specific events using keywords or locations, making it easier to search based on their preferences.
4. **Feed Buttons**: In the center of the screen, users can choose between “Nearby,” “Following,” or “Liked” feeds, offering the ability to view local events, events posted by people they follow, or their liked events.
5. **Home and Post Buttons**: On the top left of the screen, the "Home" button indicates that the user is on the main screen, while the "Post" button allows hosts to easily create and share new events.
6. **Profile Icon**: Located in the top right of the screen, the profile icon gives users quick access to their own profile to manage their account or view their posted events.
6. **Username**: Users can interact with others by hovering over a username (Here John D) in a post. This feature allows users to visit a poster’s profile by clicking on their name.

**Use Case**: 

A user searching for nearby events can enter their location or keywords in the search bar, then browse through the feed. They might spot an event that catches their eye based on the image, description and title. If they like the event, they can save it by liking the post, or explore similar events by following the user who shared it.
