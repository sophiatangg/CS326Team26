# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our web application, **OpenInvite**, are college students who are looking to be more involved on campus, meet new people, or expand their community. These individuals can range from those who are just looking for weekend plans to those who are struggling to find their place/community. Those struggling to find a community may have niche hobbies, unique cultural identities, or just simply be introverted, all of which keeps them from finding  a community they resonate with. On the other hand, it also serves individuals who looking to keep up with the social scene, find fun activities, and expand their network. 
Additionally we aim to target students in specific areas. We aim to expand beyond specific colleges, so that **OpenInvite** can be used by individuals who are looking to expand their circle beyond their campuses. For example all the students in Boston based colleges will be able to look on **OpenInvite** for events such as professional networking, career fairs, and social hang outs. Another example, is that we aim to target the 5 colleges here at Amherst, allowing users the opportunity to meet more people and learn about events on other campuses. 

## User Needs

Currently event information is scattered across multiple websites and forums including but not limited to campus pulse, social media (instagram, snapchat, etc), and flyers/ tvs throughout campus. Despite having these forums, there is no centralized location for individuals to get a complete list of all current and future events. 
Furthermore, the events listed through campus pulse and social are typically from registered student organizations which may not appeal to many individuals as they are more broad and can be hard to form conenctions during such events. **OpenInvite** will allow individuals to create their own events and effectively advertise, and such events can be more niche and have less restrictions than typical registered student organization events, fostering an environment for more genuine connections. 
Overall there is no centralized location for registered student organizations and social events that are not affiliated with the university, inhibiting individuals from being up to date and finding more events they are interested in.
