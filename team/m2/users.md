# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our web application, **OpenInvite**, are college students looking to be more involved on campus, meet new people, or expand their community. These individuals can range from those just looking for weekend plans to those struggling to find their place/community. Those struggling to find a community may have niche hobbies, unique cultural identities, or just be introverted, all of which keep them from finding a community they resonate with. On the other hand, it also serves individuals who are looking to keep up with the social scene, find fun activities, and expand their network. 
Additionally, we aim to target students in specific areas. We strive to expand beyond specific colleges so that **OpenInvite** can be used by individuals looking to expand their circle beyond their campuses. For example, all the students in Boston-based colleges can look on **OpenInvite** for events such as professional networking, career fairs, and social hangouts. Another example is that we aim to target the five colleges here at Amherst, allowing users to meet more people and learn about events on other campuses. 
Finally, we are targeting individuals who are opposed to social media. Since most registered student organizations and social gatherings are primarily promoted on social media, those who avoid using social media are constantly out of the loop and often miss meaningful opportunities. Many students choose not to use social media for mental health reasons, and by doing so, they miss out on opportunities to find communities and make connections. **OpenInvite** creates a space for organizations and individuals to advertise to those not on social media, as it doesn't foster typical social media insecurities. 

## User Needs

Currently, event information is scattered across multiple websites and forums, including, but not limited to, campus pulse, social media (Instagram, Snapchat, etc.), and flyers/TVs throughout campus. Despite having these forums, there is no centralized location for individuals to get a complete list of all current and future events. 
Furthermore, the events listed through campus pulse and social media are typically from registered student organizations, which may appeal to only some individuals as they are broader. Which also makes it harder to form connections during such events. **OpenInvite** will allow individuals to create their own events and effectively advertise. Such events can be more niche and have fewer restrictions than typical registered student organization events, fostering an environment for more genuine connections. 
Overall, there is no centralized location for registered student organizations and social events that are not affiliated with the university, which inhibits individuals from staying up to date and finding more events they are interested in. 




## Why These Users Matter

These user groups are crucial to the success of **OpenInvite** because they are at a stage where developing connections is essential to mental health and success in post-graduation life. If young individuals are not allowed to branch out and network with each other, they will eventually isolate themselves, which in turn disadvantages them in professional settings. Isolation often leads to a lack of social cues and underdeveloped teamwork/ communication skills, all of which are essential to a work environment and everyday life. Furthermore, with increased mental health awareness, students must believe they have a community and support system, which can be found with **OpenInvite**.

By addressing the specific needs of these users, **OpenInvite** aims to provide a valuable, long-term solution that will support their college social life without the use of social media. Furthermore, **OpenInvite** aims to advertise events that support a multitude of different interests, including political, educational, cultural, and social, therefore giving students an opportunity to find their communities.
